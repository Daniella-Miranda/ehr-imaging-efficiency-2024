# ehr-imaging-efficiency-2024
This project analyses whether EHR interoperability adoption within the state-level result in better outpatient imaging efficiency. This analysis uses Tableau, Excel, and publicly available CMS datasets

## Tools
- Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables)
- Tableau Public (visualization, dashboarding)
  
## Datasets
- CMS Promoting Interoperability - Hospital dataset
- CMS Outpatient Imaging Efficiency - State dataset

## Key Insights
- States with high EHR ineroperability adoption tend to have lower average outpatient imaging efficiency score.
- States with low EHR interoperability adoption show higher average outpatient imaging efficiency score.
- New York was the state witht he highest interoperability adoption, showing an average
